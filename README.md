# Penetration_Testing

### What is Penetration Testing
is a form of ethical hacking, penetration testers using strategies and tools designed to access or exploit computer systems, networks, websites, and applications These techniques help security professionals evaluate the effectiveness of information security measures within their organizations.

### INDUSTRY STANDARDS:
Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)

#### •	Pre-engagement interactions

   o-	Identifying the scope of work, the firm’s objectives, and the firm’s security goals are essential.
 
 #### •	Intelligence gathering  
 
  o-	is primarily divided into two types, 1st Passive Phase 2nd Active Phase
  
1- Passive phase, the tester gathers information that is readily available on the internet without directly interacting with the application.
    
2- active phase is wherein the penetration tester will probe the target systems to extract useful information which can be used in further analysis.

#### •	Vulnerability scanning & analysis 

o-	This involves scanning the target application for vulnerabilities using scanners to understand how the application responds to various intrusion attempts and identify security loopholes.

#### •	Exploitation 

o-	This step includes performing various exploitation techniques against the vulnerabilities identified during collected information from scanning phase

#### •	Post exploitation

o-	After the access we have and attempts to extend and elevate that access. Understanding how network resources interact and how to pivot from one compromised machine to the next adds real value for our clients. 

#### •	Reporting

o-	report provides a detailed and comprehensive analysis of the system’s vulnerabilities. It will also detail how to mitigate those issues, including recommendations for patching, hardening or locking down specific systems where needed. The goal is not only to identify problem areas that need addressing but also to provide solutions.
